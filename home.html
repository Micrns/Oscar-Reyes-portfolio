                I am a recent graduate of the University of California, Irvine with a Bachelors of Science in Informatics, specializing in Human-Computer Interaction. My interest in programming and software development stems through the use of social media platforms by understanding how much of a benefit technology has in connecting people together. I wanted to build and create platforms that allow people to interact and network themselves with other people to provide an accessible environment through the use of software. This thought process motivated me to build personal projects to learn new languages and technologies and my short-term software engineering experience at ObvioHealth aided my basic understanding of software development. 
                
                Besides programming, I am also interested in working out, fashion, and traveling.

Currently, the majority of university students are using facebook groups to find rooms and apartments that are nearby their university and are strictly for college students. Publicizing an accessible university housing application is ideal because there is a lack of options that help university students to find and secure places that are off-campus and college friendly. The entire application’s frontend and backend is built by the React.js and Node.js framework. Users can search the school they are currently attending and the application will display a variety of rooms and apartments that are available, which are posted by other university students looking for roommates. Additionally, users are able to filter their preferences by price, distance, and rooming situation (living in a single, double, or triple). Throughout the development of this project I had to learn how to properly connect MySQL with the Node.js framework and learn how to fetch and manipulate data from the backend to be displayed to the frontend of the application. This new knowledge helped in the development of account creation, by inputting data into the SQL database, and allowing users to post their apartment listing.</span>

I decided to program this application to understand more about fetching and manipulating data from an API, which in this case is the Weather API, to build a minimalistic website that displays important weather conditions. Users can search by the city name through the search bar and the website will update accordingly by the city’s current weather and time. When fetching data from the API I had to manipulate certain data to translate into a different variant of its own in JavaScript scripts. One of them being the temperature, by doing simple math to convert it into Fahrenheit, and the time to standard time instead of military time. Additionally, I had to create functions to manipulate the fetched data to display the current day of the week.
